# Body movement prediction

In this project, I got to use a machine learning method to predict the type of movement that a volunteer is exercising based on data collected from sensors attached to his body. When reading about how the data is acquired, and where the sensors are positioned, I think it is an easy task, because intuitively some movements would be separated from others simply by the differences of sensor placement. However, a quick exploratory analysis has killed all my hope, and I have to do a more sophisticated classification to solve it.

Please have a look at the notebook:
